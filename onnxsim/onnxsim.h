// (model-defined) functions into the main graph before simplifying, via onnx's

// nodes that only fed them. Both throw std::runtime_error if a name does
// not match an existing graph input/output.
// ``extra_optimizers``, when set, runs the named onnx-optimizer passes in
// addition to the default fuse/elimination set -- the counterpart to
// ``skip_optimizers``. This is how a pass registered as ``PassType::Other``
// (excluded from the default set because it is a graph-shape rewrite rather

// backend-specific op for a more portable but larger equivalent) gets
// opted into, without changing what runs by default for every other caller.
// Has no effect when ``skip_optimizers`` is ``std::nullopt`` (which disables
// optimization entirely). An unknown pass name throws (surfaced from
// onnx-optimizer's own pass registry lookup) rather than being silently
// ignored, since -- unlike a typo in ``skip_optimizers``, which just means

// The weight is quantized from its own static values only -- no calibration
// data, and (like every ``QuantizeWeightOnly*`` scheme) the activation is

// Structured (channel) pruning: removes whole output channels from
// MatMul/vanilla-Gemm and Conv layers -- real structural pruning (smaller
// weight tensors, smaller matmuls on any runtime), as opposed to
// ``PruneMagnitude``'s value-only zeroing. For every MatMul/vanilla-Gemm or
// 2-D Conv "producer" node whose output feeds, through zero or more
// shape-preserving elementwise ops (an activation, or -- MatMul/Gemm only --
// an Add/Mul against a constant per-channel bias/scale, or -- Conv only -- a
// depthwise Conv hop) with no other consumer anywhere along that path, into
// exactly one downstream "consumer" of the same family: ranks the
// producer's output channels by L2 norm of their own weight row/filter,
// drops the lowest-``sparsity``-fraction of them, and removes the
// corresponding rows/columns from the producer's weight (and bias, if
// constant) and every intermediate per-channel constant, and the matching
// columns/rows from the consumer's weight. A general grouped Conv (neither
// ``group=1`` nor fully depthwise) is matched too, as a producer and/or
// consumer, ranking/pruning each of its ``group`` channel blocks
// independently. The gated-FFN SwiGLU/GeGLU pattern is matched too -- two
// producers combined by a ``Mul`` (or ONNX opset-28+'s native ``SwiGLU``
// node) feeding one consumer, both pruned to the same combined-importance-
// ranked channel indices. A Conv or MatMul/Gemm residual (skip-connection)
// chain is matched too -- a channel-preserving ``Add(a, b)`` where both
// operands are non-constant forces whichever real producer(s) feed ``a``/
// ``b`` to agree on one shared channel-index set, resolved via a backward
// walk plus union-find grouping across such merge points that also covers a
// whole chain of such merges transitively sharing one spine channel count
// (a lone residual connection, or a linear stack of ``Add``-only merges).
// Once a group's shared channel-index set is established, it can also fan
// out *forward* to more than one independent ordinary consumer -- so a real
// multi-block ResNet/transformer stage's shared "post-block" tensor, read by
// both the next block's own first Conv/MatMul *and*, unchanged, that
// block's own ``Add``, is now reached rather than declined; a general
// grouped Conv may take part in this merge too, as a producer, the primary
// consumer, and/or an extra fan-out branch, as long as every one of those
// that is grouped shares the exact same ``group`` count. For MatMul/Gemm
// specifically, a fused
// ``com.microsoft::SkipLayerNormalization``/``SkipSimplifiedLayerNormalization``
// node -- what onnxruntime's transformer optimizer collapses a bare
// residual ``Add`` plus the following LayerNorm into, and so what a
// fully-optimized transformer's own residual connections typically look
// like -- is recognized as an eligible merge point too, its own
// ``gamma``/``beta``/``bias`` constants riding along as a per-channel
// affine hop on the resolved chain; a Conv residual chain only ever sees a
// bare ``Add`` (there is no Conv analogue of that fused op). A fused
// ``com.microsoft::BiasGelu``/``FastGelu`` node (a bias-add fused into the
// following Gelu-family activation) is recognized as a per-channel hop too,
// MatMul/Gemm chains only, and ``com.microsoft::QuickGelu`` is a plain
// unary pass-through hop everywhere a unary activation is already allowed.
//
// A ``Concat``-merged skip connection (the U-Net-style encoder/decoder
// merge) is matched too, for both MatMul/Gemm (last-axis ``Concat`` only)
// and Conv (channel-axis ``Concat``): unlike ``Add``, a ``Concat``'s
// branches are structurally independent -- each owns a fixed, disjoint
// offset range of the merged channel range -- so each branch is ranked and
// pruned entirely on its own, by the same L2-norm/combined-importance
// criterion as any other chain here; only the shared downstream consumer's
// weight needs new slicing, at each branch's own fixed offset. A branch may
// itself resolve through a gated (SwiGLU/GeGLU) combine or a whole
// Add/SkipLayerNormalization residual group; a branch that fans out
// elsewhere, or would need to cross another ``Concat`` or a fused
// self-attention op boundary, declines the *entire* group, never partially
// pruned. See ``structured_pruning_entry.cpp`` for the exact algorithm.
//
// Unlike ``Simplify``, this does not run shape inference, constant folding or
