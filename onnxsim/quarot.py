"""QuaRot (Ashkboos et al., 2024, "QuaRot: Outlier-Free 4-Bit Inference in
Rotated LLMs", https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00456). onnxsim ports the
algorithm, not any framework's code, per the same rationale as
:mod:`onnxsim.awq`/:mod:`onnxsim.gptq`/:mod:`onnxsim.quip_sharp` (QuaRot's
own reference implementation rotates and quantizes live PyTorch weights
with custom CUDA kernels, with no ONNX export path).

Every weight-only INT4 scheme already in onnxsim (`quantize_weight_only_int4`
and everything built on it -- :mod:`onnxsim.spinquant`, :mod:`onnxsim.spqr`,
:mod:`onnxsim.quip_sharp`) leaves the *activation* flowing into the MatMul in
float32: only ``W`` ever gets quantized, so the MatMul itself still runs at
float precision and pays float memory bandwidth for ``X``.
:mod:`onnxsim.smoothquant` migrates activation outliers into the weight so a
*separate* W8A8 quantizer (e.g. :func:`onnxsim.quantize_static`) can handle
both operands -- but that still tops out at INT8, since a fixed per-channel
migration can only shrink outliers, not remove the need for extra headroom
entirely. QuaRot's own contribution: the same random-rotation idea
:mod:`onnxsim.quip_sharp` already uses to make a *weight* look
incoherent/outlier-free applies equally well to the *activation* -- rotating
the entire residual stream by a random orthogonal matrix removes activation
outliers too (the same concentration-of-measure argument, applied to
whichever vector is being conjugated), letting **both** operands of the
MatMul be quantized to INT4 with plain round-to-nearest and no calibration
data at all.

    Before:
      Y = MatMul(X, W) [+ bias]                 -- W constant, [K, N], float32

    After:
      U: initializer, float32 [K, K]            -- the random rotation
      Xrot = MatMul(X, U)                       -- runtime activation rotation
      Xq   = round_to_nearest_int4_per_token(Xrot)   -- data-free, no calibration
      Wtilde_hat = DequantizeLinear(Wtilde_q, Wtilde_s, axis=0, block_size=32)
                                                  -- INT4 codes, [K, N]
      Y = MatMul(Xq, Wtilde_hat) [+ bias]

Rotating by a random orthogonal matrix ``U`` is lossless on its own
(``U @ U.T == I``); only the two INT4 round-to-nearest steps after it lose
precision, exactly as much as their unrotated counterparts already do --
the point of the rotation is that it changes *which* values get quantized:
values spread evenly across directions, rather than concentrated in a few
outlier ones (weight *rows* for ``Wtilde``, or entries of a given token's
activation vector for ``Xrot``), quantize with far less error at the same
bit width. This module reuses :mod:`onnxsim.quip_sharp`'s own
``_random_orthogonal_matrix`` (a Haar-random matrix via QR-decomposing a
random Gaussian, not the real QuaRot's Hadamard-structured construction --
see that module's own docstring for why: the concentration argument only
needs a uniformly random rotation, not a Hadamard-structured one, and a
plain orthogonal matrix is simpler to construct correctly for any
dimension without power-of-2 padding, at the deployment cost of an
``O(n^2)`` dense MatMul instead of an ``O(n log n)`` Fast Walsh-Hadamard
Transform -- the same trade-off already made, and already explained, in
:mod:`onnxsim.quip_sharp`) and :mod:`onnxsim.omniquant`'s own
``_quantize_blockwise_int4_with_clip`` for the weight side, exactly as
:mod:`onnxsim.spinquant` does.

**Why the activation needs no calibration but the real QuaRot's weight
quantization can optionally use GPTQ.** :func:`apply_quarot` quantizes
*both* operands with plain round-to-nearest: the weight offline (from the
rotated weight's own values, like :mod:`onnxsim.spinquant`), the
activation online, per token, from that token's own rotated values (the
same data-free pattern :mod:`onnxsim.kv_cache_quantization`'s Value-style
KV-cache rewrite already uses -- ``scale = max(|x|) / 7`` computed at
graph-run time, no stored calibration statistics). The real QuaRot paper
additionally offers a GPTQ-based weight quantizer for a tighter error
bound; :func:`apply_quarot_gptq` (below) provides it: it is identical to
:func:`apply_quarot` in every respect (same candidate matching, same
per-layer rotation ``U``, same data-free per-token activation
quantization) except the *weight* is quantized via :mod:`onnxsim.gptq`'s
own Hessian-based column algorithm (evaluated in the *rotated* activation
space -- see :func:`apply_quarot_gptq`'s own docstring for exactly how the
two compose) instead of independent round-to-nearest, needing real
calibration activations only for that one step.

**Scope note.** The real QuaRot rotates the *entire residual stream* by a
single, shared rotation (fused into every adjacent weight matrix -- Q/K/V/O
projections, MLP up/down, embeddings -- so the rotation is "free" at
inference, and a second, smaller online rotation handles the attention
head dimension specifically). Fusing one global rotation across an entire
decoder stack needs a model-level graph walk (matching residual-stream
add/embedding boundaries) this module does not attempt; instead, matching
:mod:`onnxsim.spinquant`'s own scope, this module fits one independent
rotation **per matched layer**, at the cost of an explicit ``MatMul(X, U)``
per layer rather than a fused, "free" rotation -- the same graph-simplicity
trade-off :mod:`onnxsim.quip_sharp` already makes for its own two
rotations.

:func:`apply_quarot_fused` recovers the "free at inference" half of that
gap without the model-level residual-stream walk: it keeps the per-layer
rotation, but wherever a layer's activation comes straight out of another
constant-weight MatMul/Gemm that feeds nothing else, it folds that layer's
``U`` into the *producer's* weight offline (``W_P' = W_P @ U``,
``b_P' = b_P @ U``) so the producer already emits the rotated activation
and no runtime rotation node is emitted at all. That fold is exact
algebra, so the accuracy is :func:`apply_quarot`'s; only the runtime cost
goes away. It is still a per-layer rotation, and layers fed by anything
else (a model input, a LayerNorm, an activation, a residual ``Add``) still
pay for their explicit ``MatMul(X, U)`` -- see that function's own
docstring for the exact fusability conditions.

    (``apply_quarot_cpp``).** The same ``seed`` does NOT produce the same
    rotation matrix, or therefore the same quantized output, on both sides
    -- and this is intentional, not an open gap. Two independent reasons,
    neither a correctness bug:

    1. Different orthogonalization algorithm. This function (via
       :func:`onnxsim.quip_sharp._random_orthogonal_matrix`) QR-decomposes
       a random Gaussian matrix with ``numpy.linalg.qr`` and then corrects
       ``Q``'s sign using ``R``'s own diagonal, because LAPACK's Householder
       QR picks each reflector's sign for numerical stability rather than
       at random, which biases ``Q`` without the fix. The C++ port
       (``passes/random_orthogonal.h``) instead uses Gram-Schmidt, whose
       natural diagonal (each row's Euclidean norm) is already nonnegative
       by construction -- so it needs no analogous correction and is
       already Haar-uniform on its own. A Monte Carlo check (K=5, 300k
       draws) found the two constructions' first-entry distributions
       statistically indistinguishable (max CDF gap ~0.0016, versus ~0.5
       against an *uncorrected* QR, which is visibly biased) -- i.e. both
       are valid, independent constructions of the same target
       distribution, not "the same algorithm, one right and one wrong."
    2. Different RNG derivation. This function sequences a single
       ``numpy.random.Generator`` across every matched layer in graph node
       order; the C++ port reseeds a fresh ``std::mt19937_64`` per matched
       node from a hash of the seed and that node's own unique id.

    Reconciling either difference for true bit-for-bit parity would mean
    reimplementing numpy's PCG64 bit generator and its ziggurat-based
    ``standard_normal`` sampler in C++ (not just swapping in a QR routine)
    -- disproportionate for a rotation whose only actual requirement, per
    the QuaRot/QuIP# papers themselves, is being *some* uniformly random
    orthogonal matrix, not a bit-specific one. ``apply_quarot`` and
    ``apply_quarot_cpp`` remain two independently-correct,
    non-interchangeable entry points; see ``passes/random_orthogonal.h``
    and ``passes/quarot.h`` for the full investigation this note
    summarizes.

    nothing at inference -- the "free at inference" property of the real
    QuaRot that :func:`apply_quarot` gives up (see this module's own
    docstring's scope note).

    Same matching, same rotations, same INT4 quantization as
    :func:`apply_quarot`; the only difference is *where* the rotation
    happens. If layer ``L``'s activation ``T`` is produced by another
    MatMul/vanilla-Gemm layer ``P`` with a constant weight, and ``T`` goes
    nowhere else, then instead of emitting ``MatMul(T, U)`` at run time
    the rotation is folded into ``P``'s own weight offline::

        T   = X_prev @ W_P  (+ b_P)
        W_P' = W_P @ U,  b_P' = b_P @ U
        =>  X_prev @ W_P' (+ b_P')  ==  (X_prev @ W_P + b_P) @ U  ==  T @ U

    so ``P`` directly emits the rotated activation ``L`` wants. This is
    exact algebra -- the fold itself loses nothing, and ``L``'s own weight
    is rotated exactly as :func:`apply_quarot` rotates it
    (``w_tilde_nk = w_nk @ u``), so ``(T @ U) @ (U.T @ W_L) == T @ W_L``
    still holds. The result is the same accuracy as
    :func:`apply_quarot` with strictly fewer runtime nodes (one
    ``MatMul`` and one ``[K, K]`` initializer fewer per fused layer).

    Note that the two rotations act on *different axes* of a weight: a
    layer's own input-side rotation acts on its reduction dim ``K``
    (right-multiply, ``w_nk @ u``), while an output-side fold acts on its
    output dim ``N`` (left-multiply, ``u_consumer.T @ w_nk``). A layer
    that is both a fused producer and a quantized consumer -- the middle
    layer of a chain ``A -> B -> C`` -- therefore gets **both**, and both
    are applied while the weight is still float, before it is quantized.
    Chains of any length are handled: this function plans every rotation
    first, then rotates every weight, and only then quantizes.

    :param model: the original (unquantized) onnx ModelProto or file path
    :param seed: seed for the random rotation matrices. Sequenced exactly
            as :func:`apply_quarot` does it (a single
            ``numpy.random.Generator``, advanced once per quantized layer
            in graph node order), so for a given model and seed both
            functions fit the *same* rotation to the same layer
    :param block_size: elements per weight quantization block along ``K``
    :param epsilon: floor applied to a token's own max-abs activation
            value before using it as a scale
    :returns: ``model`` with every matched layer quantized as
            :func:`apply_quarot` does, except that a layer whose
            activation edge is fusable carries no runtime rotation node
            and no ``U`` initializer at all

    **Which edges are fusable.** ``L``'s activation edge is fused only
    when *all* of these hold; otherwise ``L`` falls back to
    :func:`apply_quarot`'s explicit ``MatMul(X, U)`` (never skipped, never
    silently mis-rotated):

    - the activation tensor is produced by a node in the main graph that
      :func:`onnxsim.quip_sharp._match_matmul_like` matches (a MatMul, or
      a Gemm with ``transA=0``/``alpha=1``/``beta=1``) whose weight is a
      constant 2-D float32 initializer;
    - that tensor is referenced by exactly one node input in the whole
      model (subgraph bodies included) -- a tensor consumed twice cannot
      be rotated for one consumer without corrupting the other;
    - that tensor is not a graph output (a graph output must keep its
      unrotated value);
    - the producer's own output dimension equals ``L``'s reduction
      dimension ``K``;
    - if the producer has a bias, that bias is a constant float32
      initializer shaped ``[N]`` or ``[1, N]`` -- the only shapes whose
      last axis is unambiguously the output channel axis, and so the only
      ones ``b @ U`` is defined for. A broadcast/scalar Gemm bias is not
      folded, and its layer is not fused.

    **Scope, stated plainly.** This is still a *per-layer* rotation, not
    the real QuaRot's single residual-stream-wide one: each matched layer
    still gets its own independent ``U``. What this function removes is
    only the *runtime cost* of that rotation, on the subset of edges where
    the algebra above applies. Layers fed by anything other than another
    constant-weight MatMul/Gemm -- a model input, a normalization, an
    activation function, a residual ``Add``, an attention softmax -- are
    not fusable and keep their explicit ``MatMul(X, U)``. In a real
    transformer that means the projections that immediately follow a
    LayerNorm or a residual add (i.e. most of them) still pay for their
    rotation; fusing those needs the model-level residual-stream walk this
    module still does not attempt.

    """Variant of :func:`apply_quarot` that quantizes the *rotated* weight
    via :mod:`onnxsim.gptq`'s Hessian-based column algorithm (see that
    module's own docstring for the algorithm itself) instead of plain
    round-to-nearest -- the real QuaRot paper's own optional, tighter
    weight quantizer that :func:`apply_quarot`'s own docstring flags as not
    reproduced there.

    Everything about the rotation and the activation is unchanged from
    :func:`apply_quarot`: the same candidate matching, the same per-layer
    random rotation ``U`` (this function reuses ``apply_quarot``'s own
    rotation-derivation loop verbatim -- one ``numpy.random.Generator(seed)``
    sequenced across every matched layer in graph node order -- so for a
    given ``seed`` the two functions derive byte-identical rotations per
    layer), and the same data-free, per-token round-to-nearest INT4
    activation quantization at graph-run time. Only the weight-quantization
    step differs, in three parts:

    1. capture each candidate layer's real (pre-rotation) activation ``X``
       from ``model`` using calibration data, exactly the pattern
       :func:`onnxsim.gptq.apply_gptq` already uses
       (:func:`onnxsim.bias_correction._add_probe_outputs` +
       :func:`onnxsim.backend.run_model`, including its 2-D-only filtering
       of what comes back);
    2. rotate that activation by the same layer's own ``U``
       (``X_rotated = X @ U``, mirroring the weight side's own
       ``Wtilde = W @ U``) and compute GPTQ's Hessian in the *rotated*
       space, ``H = X_rotated.T @ X_rotated`` -- the space
       :func:`onnxsim.gptq._gptq_quantize_columns` actually minimizes
       reconstruction error in, since it is ``Wtilde`` (not ``W``) being
       quantized here;
    3. quantize ``Wtilde`` via :func:`onnxsim.gptq._gptq_quantize_columns`
       using that Hessian and the *same* per-``(output channel, block)``
       scale :func:`onnxsim.omniquant._quantize_blockwise_int4_with_clip`
       already computes for it in :func:`apply_quarot` (that call's own
       round-to-nearest codes are discarded -- only its scale is reused,
       since GPTQ's column algorithm takes an already-computed scale and
       only changes which integer each element rounds to, never the scale
       itself).

    **Fallback for a layer with no usable calibration data.** A candidate
    layer whose captured activation is empty (no calibration batch reached
    it) or has no feature axis at all (rank < 2), or whose feature
    dimension doesn't match the weight's own ``K``, is left completely
    alone by this
    function -- no rotation, no quantization -- rather than silently
    falling back to plain round-to-nearest quantization under GPTQ's own
    name (mirrors :func:`onnxsim.gptq.apply_gptq`'s own
    ``if not acts: continue`` skip). Note this differs from
    :func:`apply_quarot`, which never skips a layer for lack of data since
    it needs none.

    :param model: the original (unquantized) onnx ModelProto or file path
    :param calibration_data: representative input batches to compute each
            matched layer's rotated-space Hessian from. Each batch is a
            ``{input_name: np.ndarray}`` dict matching ``model``'s graph
            inputs -- see :func:`onnxsim.generate_random_calibration_data`
            (the default when omitted) and
            :func:`onnxsim.load_huggingface_calibration_data` (real data, a
            much more representative Hessian than random input).
    :param num_samples: random batches to generate when
            ``calibration_data`` is omitted
    :param seed: seed for both the random rotation matrices (identical
            derivation to :func:`apply_quarot`'s own ``seed``) and the
            random calibration data (ignored for the latter if
            ``calibration_data`` is supplied)
    :param block_size: elements per weight quantization block along ``K``,
            matching :func:`apply_quarot`'s own default
    :param percdamp: Hessian damping factor, matching
            :func:`onnxsim.gptq.apply_gptq`'s own parameter and default
    :param proc_block_size: GPTQ's own column-processing block size (not
            the quantization scale's own block size) -- see
            :func:`onnxsim.gptq._gptq_quantize_columns`
    :param epsilon: floor applied to a token's own max-abs activation value
            before using it as a scale at graph-run time, matching
            :func:`apply_quarot`'s own parameter
    :param providers: onnxruntime execution providers to run ``model`` on
            when capturing calibration activations
    :returns: ``model`` with every matched layer that has usable
            calibration data rotated and INT4-quantized (GPTQ for the
            weight, data-free round-to-nearest for the activation, exactly
            like :func:`apply_quarot`); a matched layer without usable
            calibration data is left completely untouched. A model with no
            matching layer, or an opset older than 21, is returned
            unchanged (matching :func:`apply_quarot`).

    The pure-Python rotation-plus-GPTQ implementation above has been
    retired in favor of the verified C++ port -- this is now a thin alias
    for :func:`onnxsim.apply_quarot_gptq_cpp` (``onnxsim/quarot_gptq_entry.cpp``'s
    own ``ApplyQuarotGptq``), forwarding every argument unchanged.
    **Behavior change from earlier onnxsim versions:** the C++ port draws
    its per-layer random rotation via Gram-Schmidt with an independent
    per-node RNG derivation, not this module's own sign-corrected QR
    sequenced through a single ``numpy.random.Generator`` -- the same
    permanent divergence :func:`apply_quarot`/:func:`onnxsim.apply_quarot_cpp`
    already have from each other (see that pair's own docstrings). A given
    ``seed`` therefore no longer derives the same rotation as
    :func:`apply_quarot`'s own (true in every onnxsim version before this
    alias), nor the same rotation this function itself produced before
    being aliased -- both are still independently Haar-uniform, just a
    different draw. Imported lazily (inside the function body, not at
    module scope) to avoid a circular import: ``onnxsim.onnx_simplifier``
    already imports from this module, so importing it back at module load
    time here would deadlock the import machinery.
