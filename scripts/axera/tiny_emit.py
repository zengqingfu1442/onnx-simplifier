"""Emit NPU mcode for tinygrad-traced graphs.

Pipeline: a tinygrad ``Tensor`` graph is traced to its UOp pattern,
matched by one of the ``trace_*`` functions below, and (for Neg so far)
emitted as an mcode stream assembled from a reference Pulsar2 build with
caller-chosen output scales (found by value as float32 words -- Neg
carries its output scale as four stride-7 copies).

``trace_neg``/``trace_add``/``trace_mul`` match single- or two-node UOp
patterns (unary negation lowers to ``MUL(x, CONST(-1.0))``; a genuine
two-tensor add or multiply to ``ADD(a, b)``/``MUL(a, b)`` with neither
operand a ``CONST`` -- the two ``Ops.MUL`` matchers are mutually
exclusive by that const check). ``trace_relu``/``trace_sigmoid`` match
deeper compound patterns tinygrad lowers these ops to, since neither has
a dedicated UOp: Relu is ``WHERE(CMPLT(CONST(0.0), x), x, CONST(0.0))``
(a compare-and-select, with an operand-*identity* check -- not just
shape/dtype equality -- that the ``x`` compared against 0 is the same
UOp used as the true branch), and Sigmoid is
``RECIPROCAL(ADD(CONST(1.0), EXP2(MUL(x, CONST(-log2(e))))))`` (the
standard ``e^-x = 2^(-x*log2(e))`` rewrite, checked by exact float
equality against ``-math.log2(math.e)``). Every pattern here was
confirmed by direct UOp inspection against a real tinygrad install, not
assumed from tinygrad's Python source -- these lowerings can and do
change across tinygrad versions.

None of the four new matchers has an ``emit_*`` counterpart yet (only
Neg does, via ``emit_neg``) -- see each function's own docstring and
tests/test_axera_tiny_emit.py for what tracing alone does and doesn't
give you.

``patch_mul_scales`` extends the same reference-patch idea to two-input
Mul streams' input side (sites A/C/B -- see
tests/test_axera_mcode_reciprocal.py for the field map): given the
reference build's recorded scales and the target scales, it rewrites the
input reciprocal and requant slots by value, verifying each family forms
its exact stride run. ``patch_mul_output_quad`` does the same for the
output-side scale quad (``03 <f32(z_scale)> 81 <tag2>`` x4 stride 7--
``tag2`` varies build to build, unlike the always-``81`` byte before it;
not patched, not relied on). ``patch_mul_zp_x`` patches x's zero point,
but *only* when the reference build happens to use the one zero-point
form this project has actually decoded (see below) -- it raises rather
than silently doing nothing when it doesn't apply, since whether it
applies is not predictable in advance.

What none of this touches: the S-unit programs themselves (magnitude-
adaptive shape, unmodeled ISA), the manifest string table (tensor-name
order varies build to build), y's zero point (no literal encoding found
for it at all, decoded or not), z's own zero point (see the hardware
result below -- it did not need patching, at least once), or x's zero
point when the reference build doesn't use the literal form -- which is
the common case, not an edge case (confirmed non-predictable from zp_x's
value at any magnitude, see ``TestZpXLiteralByteWhenPresent`` in the
test file). Because of that last point, and because z_scale changing
generally moves far more of the stream than the five families patched
here (A, B, C, the output quad, zp_x -- z's own calibration range shifts
the S-unit programs' internal
constants throughout, not just the named slots -- confirmed by diffing
same-shape builds at different z scales: over a thousand bytes move),
**full-stream equality after patching is not a goal and should not be
expected**; what is verified is that each named family lands on the
target build's own bytes for that family.

Status (2026-09-16): scale, output-quad and (when present) zp_x words
are mapped, verified offline (round-trip exactly, pass ``mcode.check``),
and confirmed twice on real AX650N hardware
(tests/test_axera_mul_emit_hardware.py): patching a reference build's
scales + output quad + zp_x (17 bytes total, in that one build pair)
reproduced a real rebuild's device output *bit-exactly*, not just within
quantization noise, and neither zp_y nor zp_z needed touching for that
result to hold. This supersedes an earlier note here about the emitted
stream running ~0.19-vs-0.006 against ORT -- that check pre-dated the
output-quad and zp_x work and used a different code path (``emit_neg``,
not the Mul patch functions); it has not been repeated against these.

**Practical recommendation, also hardware-confirmed**: if the calibration
data can be chosen (as opposed to given), keep it non-negative for both
inputs -- MinMax clipping then guarantees zp_x = zp_y = 0 (see
``TestSiteBFormSelectorIsZpX`` in the test file), which sidesteps
``patch_mul_zp_x`` and its "does this build even use the literal form"
uncertainty entirely: only ``patch_mul_scales`` + ``patch_mul_output_quad``
are needed, and that combination also reproduces a real rebuild
bit-exactly (second test in the hardware file). Two data points, not a
general proof -- see the hardware test file's own docstring for exactly
what is and isn't covered. tinygrad itself is an optional, lazily-imported
dependency: everything else here needs only
``numpy``.
